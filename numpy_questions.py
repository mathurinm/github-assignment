"""Assignment - using numpy and making a PR.

The goals of this assignment are:
    * Use numpy in practice with two easy exercises.
    * Use automated tools to validate the code (`pytest` and `flake8`)
    * Submit a Pull-Request on github to practice `git`.

This will be enforced with `flake8`. You can check that there is no flake8
errors by calling `flake8` at the root of the repo.
