"""Assignment - making a sklearn estimator.

The goal of this assignment is to implement by yourself a scikit-learn
estimator for the OneNearestNeighbor and check that it is working properly.

The nearest neighbor classifier predicts for a point X_i the target y_k of
the training sample X_k which is the closest to X_i. We measure proximity with
the Euclidean distance. The model will be evaluated with the accuracy (average
number of samples corectly classified). You need to implement the `fit`,
`predict` and `score` methods for this class. The code you write should pass
the test we implemented. You can run the tests by calling at the root of the
repo `pytest test_sklearn_questions.py`.

We also ask to respect the pep8 convention: https://pep8.org. This will be
enforced with `flake8`. You can check that there is no flake8 errors by
calling `flake8` at the root of the repo.

Finally, you need to write docstring similar to the one in `numpy_questions`
for the methods you code and for the class. The docstring will be checked using
`pydocstyle` that you can also call at the root of the repo.
